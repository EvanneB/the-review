# The Review

The Review is a book review and recommendation website aimed at readers who are seeking inspiration for their next read and those who want to share their thoughts and ideas on books they have read. 


 
## UX
 
### The Strategy Plane

The Review will provide information and ratings on books which will enable site users to make more informed decisions on the next book they purchase. The website will also provide a platform for readers to express their own views which will in turn assist future site users in their purchases as well as fulfilling a social need for the user by enabling interactions with like minded users.

Site users are encouraged to return to the site to share their views with other readers by leaving a review of the books they read. The website will allow users to submit, edit and delete reviews as they please through the use of an online profile. The user will also be able to vote for books they enjoyed reading, resulting in a rating system with the most favoured reads getting the most likes and least favoured books with the least votes. 

The demographic the website is aimed at is predominantly young women aged 18-29 as research shows women within this age backet read the most according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249787/book-reading-population-in-the-us-by-age/). With this in mind it is approriate for the website to take a mobile-first approach as this tech savvy demographic enjoy spending more time on their phones then other devices. 

With this target audience in mind I thought it important to include the voting system as users might want to express their love for a book but perhaps don't want to go asfar as putting it into words and publishing it on the site. This system mimics the social media sites this age demographic would be most familiar with. 

The site will contain a link beside each book which will allow the user to purchase it on Amazon. The site owners goal is to make a commission off each book purchased. The likeing and reviewing system will assist this goal by encouraging users to return to the site to give their feedback on books they have just read.

Amazon is the chosen as the book provider as it is a reliable website the target audience are familiar with and are most likely to trust to spend their money.

### The Scope Plane

The user needs advice on which books to buy. The website offers lists of the most popular books and latest releases to inspire the user and encourages reviews to inform the user. The user is encouraged to buy off impulse after reading a about a good book by clicking on the 'Buy' button below.

### The Structure Plane

Each feature on the website can be easily navigated via the navbar. For mobile users, this can be accessed by clicking on the hamburger menu after which a side menu will appear. The hamburger menu is the most appropriate for the mobile version as is optimises the use of space and it is highly recognizable to the target audience. For desktop and tablet users, the navbar will be visible from the landing page. 

The user will be able to store their information in profile on the site. This can be accessed by clicking the user icon on the top right corner of the page. First-time users will be asked to create a new profile and from here users can manage reviews they have posted about books. They will have the option to edit and delete previous reviews they have written but not those of any other user.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
